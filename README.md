Basic EDA and Data viz

Language: Python

Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/food-ordering-and-delivery-app-dataset

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook

This project is a way for me to practice standard exploratory data analysis and some basic data visualization. Throughout this project I explored the order data in New York through the Food hub app with Python. I have investigated the presence and nature of missing data and implemented mean-imputation. I have also learnt of the use of .groupby in order to find counts of a variable grouped by another variable. Finally I have done some basic bar graphs in order to display variable distribution and to visualize data such as restaurant times and time of the week with the most order frequency.
